# Time-Series-Forecasting-With-Supervised-Learning-Models
This is my personal project and experimentation on Time Series Forecasting.\
After learning about Time Series, I realised that there are many components in it that are similar to supervised learning. So I wondered if it was possible to apply supervised learning models in the Time Series Forecasting context.

### What I have learnt:
1. Supervised learning models can work in Time Series Forecasting, but the standard ARIMA model from statsmodels library still works the best as it is able to capture the seasonality and residuals better
2. Certain Supervised Learning models are completely unsuitable in Time Series Forecasting.
